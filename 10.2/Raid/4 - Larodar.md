**Fight Style:** Single Target fight with plenty of cleave 
**Recommended Setup:** 2 Tanks / 5 Healers / 13 DPS
**Useful utilities:** Rescue, Life-Grip, Guardian Spirit
**Hero/Lust usage:** Phase 2

**Summary**
By healing the injured treants, your raid will activate a powerful seed used to clear flames around the room, giving you more space to defeat the boss. Don't forget to heal the Root before Larodar unleashes a fiery explosion, it will shield you.
##### Core Mechanics
###### Phase 1:
**Seed of Life** - Once healed to full by NPCs, 3 players can interact forming a connected chain that will clear burning ground and scorched roots, until the seed’s energy is depleted. Players can only interact with the seed once every 4 minutes
	![[Pasted image 20231105203205.png]]
	- **Player 1** will go to the middle of the room and click the seed, after which a small green circle will appear around the player. Whoever runs through the small green circle will become **Player 2**.
	- Now you have 2 players with large green circles. Those circles have to be touching each other at all times, otherwise the link breaks.
	- Now that **Player 2** has the small circle, another player has to run through it to become **Player 3.** This player gains the ability to clear puddles on the ground by running through them.
	- Once all 3 players are connected, they need to make sure to not break the connection. So when you are moving around the map, all 3 players have to move in the same direction. The simple way to do this is by having **Player 1 and Player 2 follow Player 3 at all times.**
	- **Note:** Players can also get linked if all 3 click the seed in the middle of the room.

**Scorching Roots** - Small root on the ground that fixates on a random player. If hit by the Scorching Roots, the player will take damage and become rooted until dispelled!  Once killed, the roots turn into Charred Bramble just like the Treants, and have to be healed up before Larodar reaches 100 energy, otherwise you will wipe! When healed it will turn into a Life-Tree that reduces damage taken from [Raging Inferno](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=417634/raging-inferno?dd=15) by 90% but only if you are standing in the green circle.
	

**Raging Inferno** - At 100 energy, Larodar will channel [Raging Inferno](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=417634/raging-inferno?dd=15) for several seconds, this deals lethal damage to anyone not standing inside of the Bramble Barrier (Green tree).

**Blazing Thorns** - Star shaped, mini swirls around the boss that need to be dodged. The tip of each line will spawn a [Blazing Coalescence](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=426242/blazing-coalescence?dd=15) orb that needs to be picked up before they reach Larodar. Picking it up will deal a low amount of damage to the player and gives 20% increased crit chance for 10 seconds.

###### Intermission
**Consuming Flame** - After 3x [Raging Inferno](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=417634/raging-inferno?dd=15) casts, or when Larodar reaches 40%, [Consuming Flame](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=421316/consuming-flame?dd=15) will trigger. It deals heavy raid-wide damage for several seconds and forces your raid to spread out, as you take additional damage if other players are within 3 yards. All fire puddles will also move towards the boss.
	![[Pasted image 20231105203732.png]]

###### Phase 2 (40%):

Falling Embers - Small circles (3) that need to be soaked by 1 player per circle, otherwise they inflict a medium amount of raid-wide damage and give everyone a stack of [Searing Ash](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=421323/searing-ash?dd=15).
	![[Pasted image 20231105211234.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20231105211351.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20231105211217.png]]
	

Flash Fire - Several players gain a medium strength absorb shield for 8 seconds. This shield needs to be healed before it expires. If it does expire, the player will explode, dealing a low amount of damage to players within 8 yards. Additionally, it stuns the player for 20 seconds, but this can be dispelled.
	![[Pasted image 20231105211649.png]]

**Ashen Treant** - Treants will spawn all around the room, leaving fire puddles behind them as they move/die. When killed they will explode, dealing a medium amount of damage to anyone in a 3 yards range.

##### **Tank Notes**

###### Phase 1:
**Furious Charge** - Charges current target, dealing both large damage to anyone in the path and raidwide damage reduced by the distance away from boss, knocking the tank back. Charged tank takes 100% increased physical damage for 20 seconds, starting at 10 stacks and decreasing over time.
	![[Pasted image 20231105213517.png]]

###### Phase 2:
Smoldering Backdraft - Massive tank frontal cone, reducing healing received by 100% and applying a fire dot for 30 seconds. Can only heal by leeching off nearby players.
	![[Pasted image 20231105213638.png]]

##### Shit to Avoid
###### Phase 1
**Blazing Thorns** - Dodgeable spiral of swirlies.
	![[Pasted image 20231105205639.png]]

###### Phase 2:

**Fire Whirl** - Several Fire tornadoes move around the room that need to be dodged.

	![[Pasted image 20231105213232.png]]

##### Mythic Changes
###### Phase 1:
Igniting Growth - Random players will drop burning ground for 15 seconds, reduced when standing next to other burning ground
	![[Pasted image 20231105214047.png]]

**Everlasting Blaze** - After you soak a Blazing Coalescence, Applies a stack. 
	![[Pasted image 20231105204301.png]]

###### Phase 2:
Ashen Devastation - Random player is marked, run out from raid.
	![[Pasted image 20231105214428.png]]

**Smoldering Suffocation** applies **Ashen Asphyxiation**
