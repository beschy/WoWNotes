**Fight Style:** Single Target
**Recommended Setup:** 2 Tanks / 4 Healers / 14 DPS
**Hero/Lust usage:** On Pull

**Summary**
The team must split up and circle the boss to catch the continuous onslaught of lava meteors, or else risk drowning in lava.
Make sure to dodge the tail smash and splashing lava! Kill this serpent before you run out of room.

##### Core Mechanics

**Flood of the Firelands** - At 100 energy, two massive globs of lava fall to the ground and must be soaked to avoid wiping. Impact damage is split between soakers who are then knocked back. Once soaked, leaves a fire puddle on the ground.

**Coiling Flames** - Several players gain a circle that inflicts low damage to anyone standing in them, but ramps up the smaller the circle gets. It takes 10 seconds for the circle to vanish, and afterwards it will jump to another target.

##### Tank Notes
Make sure a tank is near boss at all times

**Molten Venom** - Melee attack leaves Tank Dot that increases damage taken from Cataclysm Jaws by 50%.  Swap when you gain the second stack

**Cataclysm Jaws** - Tank nuke massive Physical damage and medium fire damage to current tank.

##### Shit to Avoid
**Scorchtail Crash** - A large shadow will appear on one section of the area, mostly where there are several players standing. After a few seconds, the boss will crash his tail into that area, and deal lethal damage to anyone getting hit by it.  Additionally, it sends out several magma blobs that need to be dodged, as they deal a high amount of damage.

Tidal Blaze - Lava seeps from the crashed tails.

Volcanic Disgorge - Dodgeable swirlies that leave fire puddles.

##### Mythic Changes
At the expiration of **Coiling Flames**, not only does the debuff jump to another player, but it will trigger a **Coiling Eruption** - this eruption damage must be split by nearby players. Taking damage from two eruptions at the same time will instantly kill you. Additional organization to soak these eruptions must be assigned.

Do not soak more than one Coiling Eruption or you get Eviscerating Flames.
