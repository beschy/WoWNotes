**Fight Style:** Single Target fight with occasional Multi-DoT or Cleave targets 
**Recommended Setup:** 2 Tanks / 4 Healers / 14 DPS
**Useful utilities:** Mass Dispel (Priest) 
**Hero/Lust usage:** On Pull

**Summary**
This boss will test a variety of skills by throwing every weapon in her arsenal at the raid, including spears that need to be destroyed to free your teammates. During intermission, select which empowerment she'll use against you next.
##### Core Mechanics

**Marked for Torment** - Igira knocks players away and mark the 3 weapons.  Fully soak 1 weapon which empowers the others.
* Hacking Torment - The mechanic puts a circle on the current tank that needs to be soaked to split the damage. Once it hits, all players inside will get stunned for 10 seconds and everyone outside will receive a medium level of damage ticking DoT.  
	* TLDR: Rotate groups, do not soak more then two

* Slicing Torment - Jumps to several players' locations, dealing high damage and sends out shadow waves that also deal a high amount of damage if you get hit by them.  
	* TLDR: Run away, dodge swirlies

* Flaying Torment - Places an absorb on all players that explodes, dealing medium damage if not removed. If you remove the absorb, the player will send out several shadow orbs instead that deal medium damage to anyone hit.  
	* TLDR: Quickly heal, stay spread as you will explode.

**Blistering Spear** - Random players targeted who are tethered to the ground by a spear, dropping void zone around them. The spear must be killed to free the player.

##### **Tank Notes**
* Tanks stack to share mele swings, taunt at high stacks of Drenched Blades.

* Tank boss at wall to avoid vicious swing swipes

##### **Shit to Avoid**
Twisting Blade - Igira faces a random player and shoots 3 blades in that direction, each blade deals medium damage to players that get hit, but are easy to dodge.
