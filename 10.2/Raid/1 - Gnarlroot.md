**Fight Style:** Single Target fight with frequent add spawns.
**Recommended Setup:** 2 Tanks / 4 Healers / 14 DPS
**Useful utilities:** 4x Augmentation Evokers and 1 lucky Unholy DK.
**Hero/Lust usage:** Intermission when you have the 100% damage buff.

**Summary**
Throughout the boss encounter the raid will control how many adds spawn and whether or not they overwhelm the team.  Be ready to set the roots ablaze to clear the room during intermission by catching and spreading fire.
##### Core Mechanics
###### Phase 1:
**Controlled Burn** - Several players are marked and drop a puddle after 6seconds that awakens sleeping lashers.
	4 players will get marked with a large circle that inflicts low ticking damage to all players standing inside and will explode after 6 seconds. The explosion will leave a puddle on the ground, but will also activate all Tainted Lasher adds that it hits. Each Controlled Burn target can free every add on one of the sides.

###### Phase 2: 
**Splintering Charcoa**l - Small circle zones that can be soaked to gain Ember-Charred buff, allowing you to touch sections of roots to remove them. If not soaked, does raid wide damage.  Each player has 5 stacks from 1 swirl soak.

**Uprooted Agony** - When Doom Roots are removed, the boss takes 100% increased damage for 20 seconds and is immobilized. Afterwards, he gains a 10% damage done buff and the fight repeats from there.

* Large amount of adds Tainted Lashers / Tainted Treant(M) to taunt collect

**Flaming Pestilence** - Shoots out 4 beams of swirls, getting hit by those will inflict medium damage to the player, additionally every beam will spawn several Tainted Lasher adds that are inactive at first.
