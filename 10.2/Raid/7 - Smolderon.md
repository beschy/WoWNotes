**Useful** **Defensive Utility:** AMZ, Barrier, Darkness, Spirit Link

**Summary**
The raid must combat the power of the Firelands, dodging multiple lava waves and soaking meteors. Collect your orbs during intermission for a big damage buff, while dodging the pattern of flames –
kill the boss before you run out of space!

##### Core Mechanics

Overheated vs Soak
	![[Pasted image 20231106165016.png]]

###### Phase 1: 

**Overheated** - Half of the raid will get targeted by this debuff.  Spread out with your circle for 10 seconds then dodge fire tornadoes.

**Brand of Damnation** - Smolderon slams on tank, to be split by other players that don't have the overheated debuff.  All players are hit with Cauterizing Wound.  Tank will explode 6 seconds later, reduced by being away from raid.

* **Cauterizing Wound** - Heal absorb placed on player, when removed drops a swirlie explosion at their feet.  Players take increased damage from brand until after P2 Removes Debuff.

###### Phase 2:

**Devour Essence** - Any branded player releases living flame orbs that move towards the boss.  Only the player can see them.  If collected, grants increased damage/healing done for 20 seconds.

**World in Flames** - A pattern of rings fills the arena.  Anyone hit by the blast takes massive damage/dot.

##### Tank Notes

**Searing Aftermath** - Active tank that is branded, run out from group.

**Lava Geysers** - Tank boss near the edge

##### Shit to Avoid

**Lava Geysers** - Dodgeable swirlies fill the room with lava.

##### Mythic Changes

**Seeking Inferno** - Fireballs fixate random players, touching one deals raid damage, increasing damage taken by further explosions for 3 seconds.
