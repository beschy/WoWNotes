**Fight Style:** Single Target fight
**Recommended Setup:** 2 Tanks / 4 Healers / 14 DPS
**Useful utilities:** Gardening Tools
**Hero/Lust usage:** On Pull

**Summary**
Be careful crossing the dream lines in this room, as they leave a stacking dot. Make sure to handle the flowers of the fight well, by either soaking or dropping them away from your team! Split up at intermission to defeat the adds, then regroup.

##### Core Mechanics

###### Phase 1:
**Verdant Matrix** - Glowing green lines that are all around the arena.  Crossing them applies a stacking dot for 3 seconds.

**Weaver's Burden** - Debuff causing players to detonate after a short delay damaging nearby players and dropping a Barrier Blossom.  Grants inflorescence.  Tanks use this in P2 to lead the way to the adds.

**Surging Growth** - Small flowers that must be stood on for a few seconds to minimize raid damage.  These will explode in mythic via Reclamation.

**Inflorescence** - Players drop grass at their feet for 4 seconds, allowing others to walk unharmed through matrix lines.

###### Phase 2

**Full Bloom** - At 100 energy, the boss becomes immune and explodes with a green circle around them inflicting large damage and applying Inflorescence.  Will then summon two Cycle Wardens.

##### Shit to Avoid
* Don't cross Verdant Matrix without Inflorescence

**Impending Doom** - Glowing beams that shoot out from boss, stunning and damaging players in contact.

**Radial Flourish** - Big lines, don't touch.

**Lumbering Slam** - Big frontal

##### Mythic Changes

###### Phase 1:

**Ephemeral Flora** - Red Circle that must be soaked by players.
	![[Pasted image 20231106152311.png]]


**Reclamation** - 3 Seconds after **Ephemeral Floral**  or **Surging Growth** is soaked, it explodes in an area within 10 yards.

###### Phase 2:

**Manifested Dream** - an add that spawns with a large green circle **Waking Decimation**.  While in the circle you take ticking damage - **Lucid Miasma**.  Players outside of the miasma have their visibility obscured (Unable to target players or creatures).  Only able to go inside Lucid Miasma once as players receive **Lucid Vulnerability** for 5 minutes.
