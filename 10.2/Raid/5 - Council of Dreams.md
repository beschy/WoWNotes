**Fight Style:** 3 Target - “council boss” style fight
**Recommended Setup:** 2 Tanks / 4 Healers / 14 DPS
**Useful utilities:** Quack?
**Hero/Lust usage:** Pull

**Summary**
Each of the Council members counters a mechanic done by another - react accordingly! If you find yourself ducked, eat some flowers to return to your normal form, and continue the battle – kill them at the same time to avoid them healing.

**Duck gameplay:**
1. Run to flowers quickly
2. Press Preen button if nobody is close to you
3. If Urctos is at 100 energy, use Preen on top of him
##### Core Mechanics
**Rebirth** - All bosses must die around the same time to avoid one getting healed back to 50% health.

###### Urctos:
Blind Rage - At 100 energy, Urctos will deal a low amount of raid wide damage, growing in intensity with each tick until interrupted. After 20 seconds, he will Enrage and deal 500% extra damage, resulting in a wipe.  You can interrupt this with Ducks (yes, ducks).

###### Aerwynn:

**Constricting Thicket** - At 100 energy, conjures vines around players, slowing them and dealing damage. Cancelled by **Barreling Charge**.

**Noxious Blossom** - Green toxic flowers that you should avoid, unless you are a duck or you have a bubble around your character.

###### Pip:
**Song of the Dragon** - At 100 energy, applies an absorb on players that must be broken by standing in Noxious Blossoms.
	![[Pasted image 20231105221455.png]]

**Polymorph Bomb** - Transforms several players into ducks who can now eat Noxious Blossoms. Once you eat enough, you can Preen (dispel) to remove the debuff. When removed, passes to any player within 7 yards.
	![[Pasted image 20231105221847.png]]
Each time your polymorph expires or is removed via Preen, anyone in a 7 yards radius will get turned into a duck! So there are 2 ways you can use this to your advantage.

1. Turn your friends into ducks for fun
2. Polymorph Urctos when he is at 100 energy to interrupt him

**Emerald Winds** - Sends out winds that knock players back and deals medium damage.

##### **Tank Notes**
* Move Urctos to highest health other boss for cleave
* Tanks need to face Urctos away from everyone at all times, his frontal deals one-shot damage!
###### Urctos: 
**Barreling Charge** - Charges the current tank and hits everyone in his path, additionally he deals high raid-wide damage that is reduced by the amount of players he hits with each charge. We recommend at least 2 players per charge.  Players hit by it have to avoid the charge for 1 minute because of the Trampled debuff.

**Agonizing Claws** - Frontal Cleave aimed at the current tank. It deals a high amount of damage, so make sure to dodge it and tank swap after every cast.

###### Aerwynn
**Constricting Thicket** - At 100 energy, she will grip everyone with vines. This deals low ticking damage and slows you by 10%, increasing with each tick. After 20 seconds, if not interrupted, then it results in a wipe, in the same way as Urctos.  You can interrupt this with Urctos charge (he has to hit her).

##### Shit to Avoid
* Other Ducks

**Captivating Finale** - Players who don’t clear their absorb will be stunned for 15 seconds.
	![[Pasted image 20231105222124.png]]


##### Mythic Changes
**Dream Tactics** - The Council is even more coordinated now, allowing two of them to reach 100 energy at the same time, rotating combinations of abilities that must be dealt with at the same time.
	![[Pasted image 20231105222509.png]]

**Unstable Venom - Poisonous Javelin will now explode on other players within 10 yards when dispelled.  
	![[Pasted image 20231105222700.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20231105222608.png]]

**Whimsical Gust** - Emerald Winds now spawns tornadoes that knockback.
