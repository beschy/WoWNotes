* The Great Vault reward track has changed. Players will need to complete +18s to get Myth track rewards (up from +16s) and need to use more Aspect crests to hit max item level.

* The End of Dungeon reward track is completely unchanged, except for the Hero track, which has one additional item level upgrade. Players will still need to complete 17s or higher to get Hero track rewards.
