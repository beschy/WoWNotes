##### Bosses
###### Rezan
![[Pasted image 20231102211608.png]]
[Fight POV](https://youtu.be/Weuj82cewTQ?t=45)
[Rezan](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143577/rezan) is a single phase encounter that relies on good boss and group positioning to deal with his abilities.

Multiple  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_mount_fossilizedraptor.gif) Ancient Dry Bones](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255365/ancient-dry-bones) piles are scattered throughout [Rezan](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143577/rezan)'s encounter space. If a player moves into one of these piles, they will become slowed by 30% for 2 seconds via  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_slow.gif) Pile of Bones](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=257483/pile-of-bones), whilst also causing a Reanimated Raptor to spawn.
![[Pasted image 20231102211857.png]]
- These Reanimated Raptors will melee attack the target they have threat on, so the tank must be quick at gaining threat on them once they become active.
- Players should be constantly mindful of the  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_mount_fossilizedraptor.gif) Ancient Dry Bones](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255365/ancient-dry-bones) piles, as causing a Reanimated Raptor to spawn can cause your tank to become overwhelmed by the incoming damage.
[Rezan](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143577/rezan) will cast  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_devour.gif) Terrifying Visage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255371/terrifying-visage), causing all players within line of sight to be feared for 6 seconds. This fear can be dispelled.

- [Rezan](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143577/rezan) should be positioned next behind one of the pillars either in the centre of the encounter space, or more favorably, at the edge of the encounter space, as fewer  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_mount_fossilizedraptor.gif) Ancient Dry Bones](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255365/ancient-dry-bones) piles are present in this area.
    ![[Pasted image 20231102211954.png]]
- As soon as [Rezan](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143577/rezan) begins his  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_devour.gif) Terrifying Visage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255371/terrifying-visage) cast, all players should move to the opposite side of the pillar to create a line of sight barrier between themselves and the boss.

Shortly after [Rezan](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143577/rezan) finishes his  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_devour.gif) Terrifying Visage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255371/terrifying-visage) cast, he will cast  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_hunter_pet_devilsaur.gif) Pursuit](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=257407/pursuit) on a player. This consists of a 3 second cast which alerts the targeted player that they are about to be chased, followed by a 12 second chase!
- If [Rezan](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143577/rezan) catches up to the player, he will cast  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_mount_fossilizedraptor.gif) Devour](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255421/devour) on them, dealing near lethal physical damage over 8 seconds.
- Players should attempt to kite [Rezan](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143577/rezan) as to dodge the incoming  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_mount_fossilizedraptor.gif) Devour](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255421/devour). If a player is caught, they should use any defensive cooldown they have whilst the healer spam heals them.
- Players need to be careful not to run into the  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_mount_fossilizedraptor.gif) Ancient Dry Bones](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255365/ancient-dry-bones) piles whilst kiting [Rezan](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143577/rezan) during his  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_hunter_pet_devilsaur.gif) Pursuit](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=257407/pursuit), as the 30% slow from  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_slow.gif) Pile of Bones](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=257483/pile-of-bones) will likely result in the player getting caught.

[Rezan](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143577/rezan) will also cast  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_warrior_bloodbath.gif) Serrated Teeth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255434/serrated-teeth) on the tank. This will deal a burst off damage to the tank and apply a debuff which increases physical damage taken by 50%.
- The tank during this time should use active mitigation to try to lessen the extra incoming damage.

[Rezan](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143577/rezan) will also cast  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_misc_monstertail_07.gif) Tail](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255372/tail) when any players are stood behind him.
- This will deal a small amount of physical damage and knock back players that are stood behind [Rezan](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143577/rezan).
- Player should do their best not to stand behind [Rezan](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=143577/rezan) at any point, as the knock back from this ability may cause them to accidentally spawn extra Reanimated Raptors from the  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_mount_fossilizedraptor.gif) Ancient Dry Bones](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255365/ancient-dry-bones) piles.

##### Important Trash

###### Dazar'Ai Augurs
[Dazar'ai Augurs](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=122972/dazarai-augur) - frequently cast  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_flamebolt.gif) Wildfire](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=253562/wildfire) at a random player. This deals a moderate burst of damage and leaves a dispellable magic debuff that deals damage over time.
- Augurs will also channel  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_fire.gif) Fiery Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=253583/fiery-enchant) if a [Dazar'ai Juggernaut](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=122971/dazarai-juggernaut) is nearby. This immobilizes the Juggernaut whilst causing it to spew out lots of fire bolts that land nearby, dealing significant damage to anyone inside.
- It is highly recommended that you save an interrupt for this  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_fire_fire.gif) Fiery Enchant](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=253583/fiery-enchant) cast.

###### Dazar'ai Confessor
[Dazar'ai Confessor](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=122973/dazarai-confessor) - have two important 1.5 sec casts that the group should interrupt.
-  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_holy_aspiration.gif) Mending Word](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=253517/mending-word) will heal a mob for 25% of its maximum health.
-  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/trade_archaeology_skullstaff.gif) Bwonsamdi's Mantle](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=253548/bwonsamdis-mantle) spawns a large zone which causes all enemies inside to be immune to crowd control effects, including interrupts, silences, displacements and stuns, lasts 12 seconds.
- If this cast goes through, the tank should attempt to drag any enemies outside of the zone. This can be difficult to achieve, especially for enemies that spam cast spells, such as the [Dazar'ai Augur](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=122972/dazarai-augur).
![[Pasted image 20231102210610.png]]


###### Dazar'ai Honor Guard
[Dazar'ai Honor Guard](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/npc=127799/dazarai-honor-guard) - [Fervent Strike](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=256138/fervent-strike) Physical slash deals minor damage to tank.  Will also use Bwonsamdi's Mantle to make all nearby allies immune to CC.
![[Pasted image 20231102205342.png]]

###### Dazar'ai Juggernaut
[Dazar'ai Juggernaut](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=122971/dazarai-juggernaut) - frequently cast  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_butcher_whirl.gif) Merciless Assault](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=253239/merciless-assault), (**Avoidable**) which causes them to charge to the location of a random player (prioritizing ranged players) and deal high burst damage to anyone within 8 yards.  Will also buff themselves with  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_shamanrage.gif) Fanatic's Rage](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255824/fanatics-rage). This cast can interrupted, or the buff can be removed by spells that dispel enrage effects.
![[Pasted image 20231102210203.png]]




###### Feasting Skyscreamer
[Feasting Skyscreamer](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=128434/feasting-skyscreamer) - - They will cast  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/ability_creature_cursed_02.gif) Terrifying Screech](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255041/terrifying-screech), a 2 second interruptible cast that will fear all players for 6 seconds. This ability must be interrupted, as the fear can lead to additional packs being pulled and eventually a wipe.
![[Pasted image 20231102211405.png]]


###### Zanchuli Witch-Doctor
[Zanchuli Witch-Doctor](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=122969/zanchuli-witch-doctor)s will spam cast  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_poisoncleansingtotem.gif) Venom Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=252923/venom-blast) at random players, which deals a moderate amount of nature damage to the target.
![[Pasted image 20231102215235.png]]
- Although players can interrupt this spell, the group should not expend all of their interrupts for  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/spell_nature_poisoncleansingtotem.gif) Venom Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=252923/venom-blast), as they will want to interrupt  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_zandalaribabyraptorred.gif) Unstable Hex](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=252781/unstable-hex) as a higher priority.
- [Zanchuli Witch-Doctor](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=122969/zanchuli-witch-doctor)s will also occasionally cast  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_zandalaribabyraptorred.gif) Unstable Hex](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=252781/unstable-hex). This 1 second cast will apply a 5 second curse debuff on a player.
    - The player will be pacified and have their movement speed reduced by 30% for the duration of the debuff.
    - Once the debuff expires, it will attempt to spread to anyone else within 8 yards (as shown by the green circle around the afflicted player).
    - The debuff will continue to spread until the debuff expires on a player with nobody within 8 yards.
    - Players should interrupt this  [![](https://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/tiny/inv_zandalaribabyraptorred.gif) Unstable Hex](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=252781/unstable-hex) cast. If that fails, the afflicted player should move 8 yards away from all other players to ensure that they do not spread this curse around!
